You will need the QT 3.x developer library built for multithreading support.
To do this, download QT3 from Trolltech and configure it with
./configure -thread
Then start make and go for lots of coffees
After QT is built, don't use make install, instead, export the directory
of QT to $QTDIR
ImageSpace has no real config script, instead it uses the qmake system.
Therefore, qmake should reside inside your search tree.
Also, $QMAKESPEC has to point to a file in the QT tree defining your
system and compiler. On linux with the bash shell, this should be something
like that:

export QTDIR=/home/QT311
export QMAKESPEC=$QTDIR/mkspecs/linux-g++
export PATH=$QTDIR/bin:$PATH

Now you should be able to configure ImageSpace by changing to it's directory
and starting ./configure

If everything works, a makefile should be generated now.
Now start make, it will need only some seconds and imagespace is built.
Don't mind the 'deprecated' warnings, i had no time to check the new
C++ standard files.
Copy it to a location in your path, or start it with
./imagespace

And remember: If something goes wrong, try to check your QT system first.
It NEEDS to be built with multithreading support, and it needs to be a 3.x
version.

If you need to build it on QT/E, try the README file of my other project:
