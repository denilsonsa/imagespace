Version 0.2
* Removed a bug which caused ImageSpace to prefer trees with gray background
* Removed a bug in the multithreading system, causing a crash
* Mutation guarantee: All offspring images have at least one mutation - this
  avoids recalculations of the same genome, especially if the mutation rate
  is very low
* There should be less symmetry now

Version 0.3
* Save and load trees
* ImageSpace creates 32bit alpha-channel images now
* Added a new parameter to turn the alpha channel off
