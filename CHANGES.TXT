Version 0.2
* Removed a bug which caused ImageSpace to prefer trees with gray background
* Removed a bug in the multithreading system, causing a crash
* Mutation guarantee: All offspring images have at least one mutation - this
  avoids recalculations of the same genome, especially if the mutation rate
  is very low
* There should be less symmetry now

Version 0.3
* Save and load trees
* ImageSpace creates 32bit alpha-channel images now
* Added a new parameter to turn the alpha channel off

Version 0.4
* Trees from render windows can be transferred back to the mutation window
* Trees should be more complex now, a just-root tree should be impossible now
* Added a progressbar

Version 0.5
* Imagespace uses the QT4 API now - it can be compiled on Windows and OSX for
  free, both systems have a QT4 QPL Release
* Added a Splash screen
* Built to look good on QT/Mac. Since OSX has problems with icons inside of
  buttons, the selector window has been changed slightly.
  On Linux, it almost looks the same.
* The gaussian bell with output ]0;1] has been replaced with a bell of ]-1;1]
* The functions will be less monotonous now, since the probability of
  sinus, tanh and gauss are the same now.
* The settings are automatically loaded at application start and saved at
  application end, using QSettings to integrate with the platform
* Images can be saved in JPG format
